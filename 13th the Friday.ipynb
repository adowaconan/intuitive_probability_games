    "**The Term Ergodic .** The term ergodic is used in statistical physics, Markov chain theory and in time series analysis. In time series analysis, we say a covariance stationary time series is ergodic in the mean if the sample mean converges as the length of the time series increases to the mean over the distribution the ensemble or sample space of all possible time series. In Markov chain theory, a chain is said to be erodic if a limiting distribution exists for the states. In statistical physics, the ergodic hypothesis states for a gas in equilibrium, all states have an equal probability of realization. Our use of the term borrows from the usage in statistical physics. In simpler language, nonergodic really just means not equally probable. "

    "**Nonergodic property of Friday 13th .** A surprising property of our calendar is that not all days of the week have equal chance of being the 13th of the month if you consider the long-run. For example, if you randomly select the 13th day of any month from all years between say 2,000 AD and 1,000,000,000,000 AD then the probability that it is Friday is exactly 43/300 which is slightly larger than 1/7. Moreover, in the long-run, the 13-th of the month has a higher probability of falling on a Friday than any other weekday. "

    "**Our Calendar Cycles .** In the long-run, not every day of the week is equally probable of occurring on a given calendar date like the 13th of the month. The reason for this is due to the leap year effect which causes our calendar system to exactly cycle every 400 years and to the particular lengths chosen for our months. To show that the calendar cycles every 400 years, we compute the number of days in 400 years and note that it is divisible by 7. "
